## I have the following calculations:

#### Resolution Check:
* 0111 1111 at 0.994 Volts (127/255 == 1.027 Volts)
* 1000 0000 at 1.001 Volts (128/255 == 1.034 Volts)
* 1111 1100 at 1.983 Volts (252/255 == 2.036 Volts)
* 1111 1101 at 1.990 Volts (253/255 == 2.044 Volts)
* 1111 1110 at 1.998 Volts (254/255 == 2.052 Volts)
* 1111 1111 at 2.01 Volts  (255/255 == 2.060 Volts)
  - (Precision loss due to change in multimeter readings at 2 Volts.)
